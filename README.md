this config file is just published because I thought it would be nice to have some config files
for i3 that I could just clone if I moved devices...

I wouldn't say that look good but I do at least enjoy using them

but I would say that if I were high I would be hurling at this


[List of Cool Packages]

tdf: git@github.com/itsjunetime/tdf.git
- in terminal pdf viewer: really convenient for i3
- i just really hate csbooks and calibre
- like calibre has too many individual packages
- and csbooks is a gui mostly
- this is a nice package just for reading stuff and doing projects
